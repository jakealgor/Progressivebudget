## My app

* In my progressive budget application, the user will be shown a container where they will input a transcation name as awell as
a transaction amount. When they hit submit, the user will be shown a chart of transaction history. The information given gets 
stored onto atlas DB, locally if offline and reconnected theyre profile gets updated. The application itself is deployed with 
heroku.
